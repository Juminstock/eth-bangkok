## About the Project
This project enables the integration of a module into a smart wallet, allowing seamless cross-chain transactions by default. It leverages two or more chains simultaneously, ensuring transactions can be executed efficiently across different networks without user intervention, even when funds are insufficient on the originating chain.

### Demo
Check our demo here: [View Demo]()

### How it Works
We use Dynamic as our smart wallet provider, integrating it with a module created with LayerZero. 

When a user initiates a transaction on a chain where their wallet lacks sufficient funds, our module intervenes. It extracts the calldata from the original transaction, replicates it on other supported chains, and resolves the transaction using a Solver. 

The solver ensures the transaction is executed on-chain using LayerZero's cross-chain messaging capabilities, effectively bridging funds or resources between chains to complete the original transaction.
